    <p>We are just a group of friends and colleagues looking to inspire others by turning a disappointing outcome into a positive one.</p>
    
    <p>A group of volunteers nominated the causes promoted here. Charities were selected based on their mission, history and performance ratings as assigned by independent charity evaluation firms (e.g., GuideStar). While our selection may not please everyone equally, we are hopeful that it will be received as a compelling starting point.</p>
